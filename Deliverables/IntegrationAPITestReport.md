# Dependency graph 

     <report the here the dependency graph of the classes in EzShop, using plantuml>

# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: step1: class A, step 2: class A+B, step 3: class A+B+C, etc)> 
    <Some steps may  correspond to unit testing (ex step1 in ex above), presented in other document UnitTestReport.md>
    <One step will  correspond to API testing>



#  Tests

   <define below a table for each integration step. For each integration step report the group of classes under test, and the names of
     JUnit test cases applied to them> JUnit test classes should be here src/test/java/it/polito/ezshop

     Approach : Bottom-up

## Step 1
| Classes  | JUnit test cases |
|--|--|
|DAObalanceOperation|TestDAObalanceOperation|
|DAOcustomer|TestDAOcustomer|
|DAOloyaltyCard|TestDAOloyaltyCard|
|DAOorder|TestDAOorder|
|DAOproductType|TestDAOproductType|
|DAOlocation|TestDAOlocation|
|DAOreturnEntry|testDAOReturnTransaction|
|DAOreturnTransaction|testDAOReturnTransaction|
|DAOsaleEntry|TestDAOsaleEntry|
|DAOsaleTransaction|TestDAOsaleTransaction|
|DAOuser||
|DAOcc||
|||


## Step 2
| Classes  | JUnit test cases |
|--|--|
|EzShop, DAObalanceOperation| testBalanceOperationApi|
|EzShop, DAOorder|testOrderApi|
|EzShop, DAOReturnTramsaction, DAOreturnEntry| testReturnTransactionApi|
|EzShop, DAOproductType, DAOlocation|TestProductTypeAPI|
|EzShop, DAOsaleTransaction, DAOproductType, DAOsaleEntry|TestSaleTransactionApi|
